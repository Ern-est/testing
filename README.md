## Meme Generator App
This is a web application that allows users to register/login, add new memes, view all the memes they have added, view all the available memes, search for a meme through title or date published, update details of a meme they added, and remove details of memes they added. Users must be logged in to use the application.

The frontend of the application is built using React, while the backend is built using Sinatra. All client and API interactions are handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
